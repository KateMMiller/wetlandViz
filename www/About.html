<h3> Project Information</h3>
<p>This website presents the results of long-term monitoring of freshwater
wetlands in Acadia National Park (ACAD). The study is carried out by the <a
href="https://www.nps.gov/im/netn/freshwater-wetlands.htm">Northeast Temperate
Network (NETN) Inventory and Monitoring Program. </a><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>NETN began monitoring permanent
freshwater wetlands in ACAD in 2011. NETN defines permanent wetlands as those
that are saturated or inundated for most or all of the growing season (i.e.,
not vernal pools) and are dominated by hydrophytic plants. The overall goal of
the freshwater wetland monitoring program is to monitor status and trends in
vegetation, hydrology, soil and water quality, and indicators of wetland
condition and stressors in ACAD's freshwater wetlands (Miller &; Mitchell
2013). </p>

<p>NETN uses a three-tiered approach to wetland monitoring, where level 1 is a
GIS-based monitoring of landscape condition, level 2 is a rapid
field-assessment, and level 3 is an intensive field-assessment. NETN conducts
level 3 monitoring in 10 sentinel sites, which were non-randomly selected to
represent the best condition of various wetland types in ACAD, and are sampled
following protocols developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for
the National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA; EPA 2011a). In addition to
sampling the EPA NWCA protocol in the sentinel sites, NETN monitors hourly
water level during the growing season in the eight sentinel sites on Mount
Desert Island (MDI), the results of which are shown in the Hydrographs panel.</p>

<p>During the years between the EPA NWCA, NETN conducts rapid assessment
monitoring (RAM; Level 1 and 2) following the USA-Rapid Assessment Manual
(USA-RAM; EPA 2011b) at 40 randomly located wetland sites in ACAD. Each site is
rated using the Vegetation Multimetric Indicator (Veg. MMI; Miller et al.
2016), which rates wetland condition as Good, Fair or Poor. </p>

<p>The data and photopoints presented in the Map Panel and the Species List are from the most 
recent survey of available data. For RAM sites, the data are from 2020-2024, the second
or third sample of each site. For Sentinel sites, the data are from the 2021 survey. Note that
protected species have been removed from the data displayed here. Protected species data are 
available upon request and approval by NETN and ACAD staff to distribute. The data in 
the Hydrographs panel include all years that monitoring data are available.</p>

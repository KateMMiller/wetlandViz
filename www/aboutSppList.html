      <p>This tab lists all of the species recorded at a given site, following ITIS.gov nomenclature. Invasive species
      are noted in the Invasive column as "Yes", and invasive status follows the Invasive Plant Atlas of New England.</p>
      <p>The species presented here are from the most recent survey of available data. For RAM sites, the data are from 2018-2022, the second
sample of each site. For Sentinel sites, the data remain from the initial sample in 2011. As soon as EPA publishes the 2021 vegetation data, we will update this visualizer. Note that protected species have been removed from the data displayed here. Protected species data are available upon request and approval by NETN and ACAD staff to distribute. </p>

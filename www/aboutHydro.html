      <p>This panel displays the results of hourly water level monitoring in sentinel sites during the growing season, 
         defined as May 15 to October 1. The surface for each hydrograph is represented as a brown horizontal line at
         0 cm. Hourly precipitation in cm is displayed as a blue line on the hydrograph. Selecting points on the graph
         will output the selected points in a table below the Hydrograph. </p>
            
      <h4>Hydrograph Controls</h4>
      <p><strong>Sentinel Site: </strong>
        Choose between the sentintel sites to plot growing season water level. Changing the site will automatically 
        update the values in the growing season statistics table, and the data to select in the hydrograph.</p>

      <p><strong>Years to plot: </strong>
        Choose the years to plot and calculate growing season statistics for. Changing the years will automatically 
        update the values in the growing season statistics table, and the data available to select in the hydrograph.</p>

      <p><strong>Download Hydrograph: </strong>
        Downloads a jpg of the hydrograph and names it based on the site and years plotted.

      <p><strong>Growing Season Stastics: </strong>
        Allows you to view a specific water level statistic for the years selected above. 
         <ul>
           <li><u>Mean Water Level (cm)</u> is the average water level in cm during the growing season.  </li>
           <li><u>SD Water Level (cm)</u> is the standard deviation in cm of growing season water level.  </li>          
           <li><u>Minimum Water Level (cm)</u> is the minimum water level recorded in cm during the growing season.  </li>
           <li><u>Maximum Water Level (cm)</u> is the maximum water level recorded in cm during the growing season. </li>     
	   <li><u>Maximum hourly increase (cm)</u> is the maximum increase in water level within an hour during the growing season.</li> 
           <li><u>Maximum hourly decrease (cm)</u> is the maximum decrease in water level within an hour during the growing season.</li>
           <li><u>Growing Season Change (cm)</u> is the change in cm in growing season water level by comparing the average water levels for June and September. </li>  
           <li><u>GS % surface water</u> is the % of the growing season that water level was above the surface.</li>           
           <li><u>GS % within 30cm</u> is the % of the growing season that water level was within 30 cm of the surface.</li>            
           <li><u>GS % over 30cm deep</u> is the % of the growing season that water level was below 30 cm of the surface. </li>   
       </ul>

      <p><strong>Data from selected points: </strong>
        The data in this table are based on the points selected by the mouse in the Hydrographs. The column names are defined below:
      <ul>
           <li><u>Column 1</u> is the row number for a given record in the water level dataset.</li>      
           <li><u>timestamp</u> is the hourly timestamp in Eastern timezone.</li>
           <li><u>year</u> is the year the data were collected.</li>
           <li><u>doy_h</u> is the calendar day of the year (range 1 to 365) followed by the hour of the day in decimal points (range .01 to .24). Field is only used for plotting.</li>
           <li><u>SITE_WL</u> is the hourly water level in cm for a given sentinel site, based on the 4-letter site code. </li>
           <li><u>precip_cm</u> is the hourly precipitation amount in cm.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This map displays the results of an ongoing permanent freshwater wetland monitoring program conducted by the National 
         Park Service's Inventory and Monitoring Program. Each circle indicates the location of a permanent wetland monitoring plot.
         Clicking on a circle will produce a popup with the name of the site and information about the value that is being mapped. 
         The photopoints from that site will also be displayed at the bottom of the window. </p>
       <ul>
            <li><b>Sentinel Sites</b> are targeted sites that are monitored intensively following the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
                   National Wetland Condition Assessment methods.</li>
            <li><b>RAM Sites</b> are rapid assessment monitoring sites that are randomly located and sampled following the EPA USA-RAM, 
                   a manual for Level 1 (GIS-based) and Level 2 (rapid field assessment) methods.</li>   
            </ul>
<p>The data and photopoints presented in the Map Panel are from the recent survey of available data. For RAM sites, the data are from 2017-2020, the second sample of each site. For Sentinel sites, the data remain from the initial sample in 2011. As soon as EPA publishes the 2016 vegetation data, we will update this visualizer. Note that protected species have been removed from the data displayed here. Protected species data areavailable upon request and approval by NETN and ACAD staff to distribute. </p>

      <h4>Map Controls</h4>
      <p><strong>Type of data: </strong>
        This control allows you to toggle between the different types of data to view. Changing the data type will automatically 
        update the values on the map legend, the data that can be mapped, and the options available for mapping.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Veg MMI:</b> is the Vegetation Multimetric Indicator, an index from 0 to 100 that measures and rates the 
                   condition of the vegetation at that site.</li>
            <li><b>By Site Type:</b> indicates the location of sentinel and RAM sites.</li>
            <li><b>By Species:</b> allows you to view species locations on the map.</li>
	    <ul>
                <li><u>All species</u> allows you to select an individual species to plot locations on the map</li>
                <li><u>Invasive species</u> allows you to view all plots where at least one invasive species was detected</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
